Tourists can cover the key highlights of Kerala including the Port town of Cochin, the tea plantations of Munnar, the wildlife in Periyar, the houseboats on the backwaters in Alleppey and end their stay at Marari where they can enjoy the beaches before flying out of Cochin again- instead of having to travel down south to Kovalam for the beaches. The beaches in Marari are conveniently located just an hour and a half away from the Cochin international airport.</p>
